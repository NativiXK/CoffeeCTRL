# **Coffee control WEB application**

#### **Video DEMO:** (https://www.youtube.com.br)

#### **Description**: :smiley::rocket:

For CS50 final project I created a Web application using the following tools:

| Tool | Used for |
|:---|---| 
| **Python** | Backend application and API |
| Flask | Web Framework for python |
| Html | Web pages structure |
| css | Web pages style |
| Javascript | End-point application  
| SQL (sqlite) | Data persistence

The core ideia is for each coffee admin with its credentials have access to its own coffee group and control purchases, payments, entrance and exit of contributors, also to give to the person in charge of the group a reliable way to control the cash flow in the group.

Coffee users are displayed in a table that shows their payments or lack of it, by clicking at any row a toolbox for the user appear in which is possible to add payment, to edit user payments.

By clicking on each user row, it is possible to add a new payment, to edit all payments made by the person, to edit the contact and remove the person from the group.
